# Requirement 1

> User must be able to create an account and log in. (If a mobile application, this means that more users can use the app from the same phone).

The login page has a `Register` link

When that link is pressed, a new user can be registered using the registration form:

Once the registration form is filled, the new user can login into the application using the new username and password.

The fields username and password are required in the registration form. By default all new registered users are regular users (role regular).
