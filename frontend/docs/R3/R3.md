# Requirement 3

> Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.

There are 3 different roles:

- Regular
- Manager
- Admin

When an admin user creates another user, the page allows to specify the role of that new user. Manager users can also set a role, but only regular or manager, not admin.

Regular users can see only their trips and profile page.

Manager users can see their trips, profile and the users list management page.

Admin users can manage all trips, profile and the users list management page. Notice the user name is displayed in the trips list, and the list can be filtered by user as well.

The user dropdown reads the users from the API, filtering by first name or last name.
