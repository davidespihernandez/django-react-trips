# Requirement 2

> When logged in, a user can add trips, and edit and delete their trips.

Once a user is logged in, the default page is the trips page, where the list of trips for that user is displayed.

The user can create a new trip using the `Create new` button.

The user can also edit an existing trip by clicking on the trip id in the trip list page.
