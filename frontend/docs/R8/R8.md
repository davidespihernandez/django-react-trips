# Requirement 8

> REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you donâ€™t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).

The web application is a React single page application that uses the Django backend API for everything, including authentication (using JWT tokens). Data is stored in a postgres database.

There's a postman collection in the backend folder to test the API separately.
